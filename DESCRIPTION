Title: functions for retrieving historic climate data and the six-day forecast from the Dutch meteorological institute KNMI
Author: Bart van Hest [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Bart van Hest <hestbv@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides functions to retrieve raw and processed climate
    data from the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). For some stations data goes back to 1900.
    With helper-functions, the data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned
    data is converted to SI-units, when necessary. Several additional helper functions
    are available, such as a function that calculates the Huglin- or VE-index.
    The package also contains two KNMI datasets with all measurement stations and with 
    long term averages from 2000-2015.
