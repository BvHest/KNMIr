Author: Bart van Hest [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Bart van Hest <hestbv@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides functions to retrieve raw and processed climate
    data from the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). For some stations data goes back to 1900. Two functions 
    are provied to retrieve the 6-day weather forecast from the KNMI and the 14-day forecast from the Weerplaza-website.
    With helper-functions, the data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned
    data is converted to SI-units, when necessary. Several additional helper functions
    are available, such as a function that calculates the Huglin- or VE-index.
    The package also contains two KNMI datasets; one with all measurement stations and one with 
    long term averages from 2000-2015.
