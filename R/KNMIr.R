#' KNMIr: functions for retrieving historic climate data and the six-day forecast from the Dutch meteorological institute KNMI.
#'
#' This package provides functions to retrieve raw and processed climate
#' data from the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). For some stations data goes back to 1900.
#'
#' With helper-functions, the data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned
#' data is converted to SI-units, when necessary. Several additional helper functions
#' are available, such as a function that calculates the Huglin- or VE-index.
#'
#' The package also contains two KNMI datasets with all measurement stations and with
#' long term averages from 2000-2015.
