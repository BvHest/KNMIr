ToDo:

  - DONE: add the data from the sea-based stations
  - turn station-parameter in stations-parameter (so that a list of stations can be downloaded in one call)
  - DONE: retrieve the six day forecast from the KNMI-website.
  - provide English names for the variable-codes, next to the Dutch translations.
  - change source of KNMI stations to http://projects.knmi.nl/datacentrum/catalogus/catalogus/catalogus-gegevens-overzicht.html
