# KNMIr-package - R functions for retrieving climate data from the Dutch meteorological institute KNMI.

## Description

This package provides functions to retrieve climate data (up to 'yesterday') for the offical KNMI weather stations from 
the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). In addition, a six day forecast can be retrieved from the KNMI-website and a 14-day forecast from the Weerplaza-website.
The data-set contains multiple variables. 
For some stations, data goes back to 1900. 

The data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned data is converted to SI-units, when 
necessary. 
Several additional functions are available, such as a function that calculate the Huglin- or VE-index. 

The package also contains two KNMI datasets, one with the measurement stations, both on and and at sea, and the other with a reference set of long term averages over the period 1999-2014.
