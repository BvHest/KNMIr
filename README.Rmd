# KNMI-package - functions for retrieving climate data from the Dutch meteorological institute KNMI.

## Description

This package provides functions to retrieve climate data (up to 'yesterday') for the offical KNMI weather stations from 
the official Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). 
The data-set contains multiple variables. 
For some stations, data goes back to 1900. 

The data can be subsetted based on year and specified variables. The returned data is converted to SI-units, when 
necessary. 
Several additional functions are available, such as a function that calculate the Huglin- or VE-index. 

The package also contains two KNMI datasets with the measurement stations and with a reference set of long term 
averages over the period 1999-2014.

ToDo: 

  - DONE: add the data from the sea-based stations
  - turn station-parameter in stations-parameter (so that a list of stations can be downloaded in one call)
  - DONE: retrieve the six day forecast from the KNMI-website. 
  - provide English names for the variable-codes, next to the Dutch translations.
  - change source of KNMI stations to http://projects.knmi.nl/datacentrum/catalogus/catalogus/catalogus-gegevens-overzicht.html
